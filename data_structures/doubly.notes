Doubly Linked Lists

    - linear
    - almost identical to singly linked lists, however, every node has another pointer to the previous node (operates in both directions)
    - more efficient than singly linked lists because you can work backwards on the list which makes popping off the last value much easier
    - more flexibility than sinlgy linked lists, but as a result it takes more memory.
