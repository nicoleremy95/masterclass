//RULES 
//Constants don't matter
//arithmetic operations are constant
//variable assignment is constant,
//Accessing elements in an array (by index or object (by key)) is constant
//In a loop, the complexity is the length of the loop times the complexity of what happens inside

//EXAMPLES
//O(2093) should be written as O(1)
//O(2n) should be written as O(n)
//O(n+10) should be written as O(n)
//O(n^2 +8) should be written as O(n^2)
//O(n^2 + 5n + 8) should be written as O(n^2)
